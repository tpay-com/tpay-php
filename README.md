## Configuration

The only thing you need to do is to set your API access data via `$this->` ([see examples](examples)).
You can generate access keys in [Tpay's merchant panel](https://secure.tpay.com/panel).

The [`loader.php`](examples/BasicPaymentForm.php) file handles all required class loading, so you can include this file to any file you are editing.
(remember to configure your current working path correctly).

All methods described in [Tpay documentation](https://docs.tpay.com) can be easily executed by extending required class in main [`src`](src) directory ([see examples](examples)).

##### Basic Payments and bank selection forms

Example of usages: [basic](examples/BasicPaymentForm.php), [bank selection HTML form](examples/BankSelection.php), [bank selection API form](examples/BankSelectionAPI.php), [BLIK form](examples/BlikTransactionExample.php).

##### Transaction API / create, get, refund, report

Example of usages: [create transaction](examples/TransactionApiExample.php), [refund transaction](examples/TransactionRefund.php), [refund transaction status](examples/TransactionRefundStatus.php).

##### Card Basic / Card On-Site

Example of usages: [card basic form](examples/CardBasic.php), [card on-site gateway](examples/CardGate.php), [card payment links builder](examples/CardPaymentLinkBuilder.php), [card on-site gateway with saved cards](examples/CardGateExtended.php).

## Logs

Library has own logging system to save all confirmations and notifications sent by Tpay.com server, outgoing requests and exceptions.
Be sure that file `src/Logs` directory is writable and add rule to Apache `.htaccess` or NGINX to deny access to this area from browser.
The log files are created for each day separately under `Logs` directory.

The logging is enabled by default, but you can disable this feature with:
 ```php
Util::$loggingEnabled = false;
 ```

You can also set your own logging path by this command:
 ```php
Util::$customLogPatch = '/my/own/path/Logs/';
 ```

The logs file names will be assigned automatically.

## Custom templates path

You can set your own templates path, so you can copy and modify the `phtml` template files from this library.
 ```php
Util::$customTemplateDirectory = '/my/own/templates/path/';
 ```

## Language

Currently, the library supports two languages (English and Polish). Default language is English.
Changing language example:
```php
// All Tpay class constructors load Lang class
$tpay = new BankSelectionExample();

// After this line all static messages (input labels, buttons titles etc.) will be displayed in Polish
(new Util())->setLanguage('pl');

// If you want to access translations manually, use:
$language = new Lang();
$language->setLang('pl'); // for setting language
$language->l('pay'); // to echo translated key
```
